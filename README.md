The code starts by importing the necessary modules.
The tkinter module provides the basic interface for creating graphical user interfaces in Python.
Next, the colors variable stores a list of six colours, as well as a score variable.
The startGame() function is called when the game starts.
This function initializes some variables and sets up the game play.
First, it checks to see if time has expired (in which case the game is over).
If time hasn't expired, then it runs the countdown() function to keep track of how much time is left in the game.
Finally, it sets up two labelsâ€”one to display the current time left and another to display the player's score.
Next, we create a driver code block that creates and displays a window onscreen.
We set its title and size before adding an instructions label to it.
The instructions label contains text that tells players what they need to do in order to play this game: type in one of six colour values into the text entry box below it, not just word text!
After you type in your colour value, hit enter key on your keyboard to submit it and begin playing!
The code creates a window that has the title "COLORGAME" and a label for instructions.
The window is 375x200 pixels in size, and the label is added to the window at (0, 0).
The next section of code sets up some variables.
The first variable, 'colours', stores an array of six colours: Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Black, and Yellow.
The second variable, 'score', stores the current score of the game.
The third variable, 'timeleft', keeps track of how much time is left in the game.
The next section of code creates a function called 'startGame'.
This function will be used to start the game timer when it is clicked on by the user.
